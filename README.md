# ai-fundamentals

My own models/experiments on the way to learn the fundamentals of artificial intelligence.

I started this repo as part of an online course about AI fundamentals. Before uploading
my models, I try them out on a private IPython notebook. Then I upload both the Python code
and the notebook here on GitHub for further use and edits.

**NOTE:** The models' notes and comments are written in Spanish (my native language),
though the main docs are in English (as usual)...
