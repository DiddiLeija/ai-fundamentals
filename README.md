# ai-fundamentals

My own models/experiments on the way to learn the fundamentals of artificial intelligence.

I started this repo as part of an online course about AI fundamentals. Before uploading
my models, I try them out on a private IPython notebook. Then I upload the Python code
here on GitHub for further use and editing.
